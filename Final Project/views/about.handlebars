We are a new gaming store in the pacific northwest looking to share our passion and good times over a board game! Cofounded by Laura and Mario, the game store specializes in board games and trading card games. 
<i>Mario’s story</i>
When you grow up on the western side of the state of Washington, a lot of your recess time as a kid is spent in the classroom. As much as I loved to read as a youngster, it was a lot more fun to play with the collection of board games our teachers had and time allowing, even play a little chess. For me this is really where the passion for table top games started. Meanwhile back at home video games were pretty much seen as the devil’s work leaving me to play even more board games with my two younger brothers. 
<br />
<br />
Fast forward some years, my board game collection grows and I take a liking to the trading card game Magic the Gathering sometime in 2007. Now as an adult I can pretty much play as many video games as I please, however there isn’t really anything quite like playing a game of dominos, or Settlers of Katan with your family/friends. 
<br />
<br />
And that’s what <i>Troll Under the Bridge</i> games is all about! Fun times and comradery playing the classics like Go or Chess in one of our sound proofed rooms, or arguing what is the next best move over a game of <i>PandemicTM.</i>
